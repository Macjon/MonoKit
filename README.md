MonoKit
=======

MonoKit originally started out as a library in a similar vein to MonoTouch.Dialog.  It has some elements of this, but has diverged to include other features as well.  It is still in progress :)

- A TableViewSource to build table views using a binding framework and "templating cells".  This is probably about 50% done.

- A CQRS / Event Sourcing framework.  This is about 75% - quite functional just missing some extras.

- A port of ViewDeck (https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck).  This is complete and functional.  There is a sample in the samples folder that shows how to use this.  Also the original ViewDeck project has some good documentation as well.

- A Panorama View.

- A port of AwesomeMenu (https://github.com/levey/AwesomeMenu).


I look forward to any comments you might have.
