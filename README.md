MonoKit
=======

MonoTouch library akin to MonoTouch.Dialog

So far this project has the basic framework for handling UITableViews in a manner similar to MonoTouch.Dialog.
It also has some lightweight binding support.

Work in progress at the moment includes a framework for CQRS and Event Sourcing.  I hope
to add in synchronisation features as well.

There are 2 sample applications, iPhone and iPad that show most of the features of the library at present.  

I'll be adding more samples and work on base features over the next while.  

I look forward to any comments you might have.

Cheers.
